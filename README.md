Exploring the Utility of JPEG Compression for Medical Scan Classification Tasks (imported from Kaggle)
  
A ResNet-50 model was fine-tuned to detect COVID-19 in chest X-rays (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

Adversarial noise was generated using FGSM

Performance of the model was measured using AUC score, accuracy, and loss as the perturbed images were subjected to increasing magnitudes of JPEG compression
